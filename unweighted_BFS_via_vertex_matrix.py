'''
We can do BFS/DFS 2 ways via adjacency list or vertices matrix
Here I am trying to solve BFS via vertices matrix.

When popping the stack pop from the front not from the back
because we want to visit the node in ascending order
For example if 1 has children 6 and 21 then we want to go to
6 before 21.
